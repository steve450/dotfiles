# Dot Files
My dot files shared between machines for ZSH, Bash, OSX, Linux, Cygwin and MSYS.

# Fork

This is my fork of Mike McQuaid's [awesome dotfiles](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/dotfiles).

# Changes

I've added appconfigs for specific apps I want setup.  Unfortunately many will be unique so I intend to use a ./setup config
for each.

## Installation
Customise the contents of [`gitconfig-user`](https://github.com/steve450/dotfiles/blob/master/gitconfig-user).
This is used for user-specific customisations of every other file.

Run [`script/setup`](https://github.com/steve450/dotfiles/blob/master/script/setup)
after checkout to symlink (or copy) everything in this directory to your home directory.

## Status
I'm using these on all my personal machines.
